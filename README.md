# ACad SVG Studio

A simple application to load and convert AutoCAD DWG documents to SVG using [ACadSVG](https://github.com/nanoLogika/ACadSvg) and [ACadSharp](https://github.com/DomCR/ACadSharp). 
SVG code can be viewed and edited SVG in a Scintilla text editor. The result is displayed in an integrated browser control.

*ACad SVG Studio* was designed to support projects with a produktLogika product configurator
that combines parts of 2D drawings created in AutoCAD. [produktLogika](https://www.nanologika.de/produktkonfigurator/) is nanoLogika's catalog-based product configuration system.

Thus the converter focuses on converting the block structure, especially dynamic blocks, rather than just converting a drawing.
